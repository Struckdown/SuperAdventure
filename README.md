# SuperAdventure
Simplish RPG

//A read me! That's what I've been forgetting!

This project is a learning experience that I decided to take up mostly for fun. My knowledge of C# is relatively limited, so I felt like expanding it through practice. I also wanted to learn a little about Visual Studios since I think it will be useful. Experience is important after all!

The tutorial I'm following is here: https://scottlilly.com/learn-c-by-building-a-simple-rpg-index/

While I would like to expand upon this project just for the fun of it, that's unlikely as most of my time is taken up with university base projects. I think it'd be fun to make a 5-10 minute adventure game, but I'm busy making games for classes.

Feel free to try SuperAdventure. It's done in Windows. Download the repo, open it up with Visual Studios, build and run.

In regards to licenses and such, this is a personal project done for practice and fun. I acknowledge that the vital foundations of the code stem from the tutorial and as such, this is not meant to be distributed for-profit in any way.
