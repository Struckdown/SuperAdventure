# SuperAdventure
Simplish RPG

//A read me! That's what I've been forgetting!

Heya there! I'm not sure how you found this project, but it's neat that someone else is looking at my stuff, for whatever reason!
This project is a learning experience that I decided to take up. My knowledge of C# is relatively limited, so I felt like expanding it.
I also wanted to learn a little about Visual Studios since I think it will be useful. Experience is important after all!

The tutorial I'm following is here: https://scottlilly.com/learn-c-by-building-a-simple-rpg-index/

I'm hoping to expand the project when I finished it and primarily just add more content, even if not all of it is "New" features,
just for the fun of it. I think it'd be fun to make a 5-10 minute adventure game.

Feel free to try it, hopefully it works for you!

On a side note, in regards to licenses and such, this is a personal project done for practice and fun. I accept that the foundations of the code stem from the tutorial and will hopefully be eventually modified over time.
